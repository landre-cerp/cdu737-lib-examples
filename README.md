# How to test

On my development machine, though i'm used to develop in WSL most of the time, for this project, i had to do it on windows  (Device was not seen in wsl, i think i read it was possible but i did not needed it to work on wsl, so i decided to stick to command prompt and use windows node.)

- clone this repo 

```bash
npm install
```

should install latest cdu737lib

try examples 

to show Manufacturer , product name and serial number 
```bash
node showDevice.js
```

to make some leds blink
```bash
node blink.js 
```

```bash
node example.js
```
